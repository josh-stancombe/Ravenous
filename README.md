# Ravenous
React project created as part of Web Development Career Path on Codecademy. Focusing on React and API functionality.<br><br>
<b>Objective:</b> <br>
Welcome to the Ravenous project! During this project, you’ll build a website called “Ravenous”, a Yelp-like clone. In total, there will be four parts to this project:
<br><br>
    1. Creating Static Components <br>
    2. Passing Information to Components <br>
    3. Setting the State of Ravenous Components<br>
    4. Interacting with the Yelp API<br>
<br>
Here’s a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:<br>
    <i>- As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants<br></i>
    <i>- As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API<br></i>
    <i>- As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter<br></i>
<br>
The four projects will test your knowledge of JavaScript and React, all with the goal of building a Yelp-like clone. If you want to get a feel for what Ravenous can be, visit the Yelp website and search for restaurants in your area.
